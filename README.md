# Revit-Optimization

In this project, I used Naive Bayes Classifier to predict door parameters from the rooms names in a hospital project. 

The work is still in process. I will be collaborating with BIM team to collect more data from diffent projects.

Currently we have a general accuracy of 90%. This application could be used in later design work to provide autofilling of parameters. 

On specific rooms, designers still have to check everything but it simplifies the work flow and has a lot of potential as AI-assisted design.
